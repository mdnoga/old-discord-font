# Old Discord Font


## Custom CSS in BetterDiscord
Most client mods have a Custom CSS tab. Paste this line into the top of your Custom CSS.
```css
@import url(https://cdn.statically.io/gh/mdnoga/old-discord-font/main/source.min.css);
```
If you're uncomfortable with using the import, copy everything from [here](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/mdnoga/old-discord-font/main/source.min.css) and paste it.

# Credits
[Discord](https://discord.com/) for basically making the css lol
