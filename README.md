# Old Discord Font

Simple CSS to revert Discord's font change back to Whitney. 

The CSS was made by Discord themselves (I don't take any credit for the CSS, and anyone taking credit is likely delusional), however I'm hosting the fonts on GitHub in order to prevent risk of them being taken off Discord's Servers.


## Custom CSS
Most client mods have a Custom CSS tab. Paste this line into the top of your Custom CSS.
```css
@import url(https://cdn.statically.io/gh/mdnoga/old-discord-font/main/source.min.css);
```
If you're uncomfortable with using the import, copy everything from [here](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/mdnoga/old-discord-font/main/source.min.css) and paste it.

# Credits
[Discord](https://discord.com/) for basically making the css lol
